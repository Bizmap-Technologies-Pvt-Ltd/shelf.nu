# Reconciliation RFID Integration - Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Previously Scanned Items Showing as "Unknown" After Fetching New Assets

**Problem**: When users fetched new assets in the reconciliation dialog, previously scanned items would incorrectly show as "Unknown" because the merging logic was not properly preserving existing scanned items.

**Root Cause**: The `fetchAssets` function was overwriting the entire scanned items list instead of properly merging new results with existing ones.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the merging logic in `fetchAssets` to properly append new reconciliation items to existing ones
- Updated manual entries update logic to check if an RFID was already in scanned items before processing
- Added validation to only mark entries as "Asset Not Found" if they were actually included in the current fetch request

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Overwriting existing scanned items
const allReconciliationItems = [...scannedItems, ...newReconciliationItems];

// AFTER: Properly preserving existing items and only updating relevant manual entries
// Check if this RFID was already in our scanned items (duplicate)
const existingScannedItem = scannedItems.find(item => 
  item.rfidTag.toLowerCase() === entry.rfidTag.trim().toLowerCase()
);

// Only mark as "Asset Not Found" if it was in the tags we fetched
if (tagsToFetch.some(tag => tag.toLowerCase() === entry.rfidTag.trim().toLowerCase())) {
  // Mark as not found
} else {
  // Keep existing data unchanged
}
```

### 2. Duplicate RFID Tags Not Showing "Already Scanned" Status

**Problem**: When users entered RFID tags that were already scanned, the system would either allow duplicates or show them as "Unknown" instead of clearly indicating they were already scanned.

**Root Cause**: There was no validation in the `updateRfidTag` function to check for duplicates against existing scanned items.

**Solution**:
- Added duplicate detection in `updateRfidTag` function
- Implemented "Already Scanned" status display for duplicate entries
- Added appropriate styling (blue badge) for "Already Scanned" status
- Filtered out duplicate tags from being sent to the server

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added duplicate detection in updateRfidTag
const isDuplicate = value.trim() && scannedItems.some(item => 
  item.rfidTag.toLowerCase() === value.trim().toLowerCase()
);

if (isDuplicate) {
  return {
    ...entry,
    rfidTag: value,
    assetName: "Already Scanned",
    category: "Duplicate",
    status: "Already Scanned",
    location: "Already Scanned",
  };
}

// Added styling for "Already Scanned" status
entry.status === 'Already Scanned' ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800' :
entry.status === 'Unknown' ? 'bg-red-100 text-red-800' :
```

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Validation
- Added validation to prevent fetching when no new RFID tags are available
- Improved error messages to be more descriptive and user-friendly
- Added proper handling for edge cases where all entered tags are duplicates

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added distinct color coding for different status types:
  - Available: Green (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)
  - In Use: Yellow (`bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800`)
  - Already Scanned: Blue (`bg-blue-100 text-blue-800`)
  - Unknown/Not Found: Red (`bg-red-100 text-red-800`)
  - Default: Gray (`bg-gray-100 text-gray-800`)

### Code Quality
- Improved logic separation between duplicate detection and asset fetching
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Better state management for resume functionality

## Testing Scenarios

The following scenarios should now work correctly:

1. **New RFID Entry**: Enter a fresh RFID tag → Shows correct asset info or "Asset Not Found"
2. **Duplicate RFID**: Enter an RFID that was already scanned → Shows "Already Scanned" status
3. **Resume Workflow**: Fetch assets, then add more RFIDs → Previously scanned items remain unchanged
4. **Mixed Batch**: Enter both new and duplicate RFIDs → New ones are fetched, duplicates show "Already Scanned"
5. **No New Tags**: Try to fetch when all entered tags are duplicates → Shows appropriate error message

## Files Modified

- `/app/components/reconciliation/scan-rfid-dialog.tsx` - Main fixes for duplicate detection and merging logic

## Workflow After Fixes

1. User enters RFID tags in manual entry fields
2. System validates for duplicates in real-time
3. Duplicate tags immediately show "Already Scanned" status with blue styling
4. "Fetch Assets" only processes new, unique RFID tags
5. Previously scanned items are preserved during fetch operations
6. Results are properly merged without data loss
7. Clear visual indicators for all status types
